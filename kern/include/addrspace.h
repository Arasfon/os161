 * Functions in addrspace.c:
 *
 *    as_create - create a new empty address space. You need to make
 *                sure this gets called in all the right places. You
 *                may find you want to change the argument list. May
 *                return NULL on out-of-memory error.
 *
 *    as_copy   - create a new address space that is an exact copy of
 *                an old one. Probably calls as_create to get a new
 *                empty address space and fill it in, but that's up to
 *                you.
 *
 *    as_activate - make curproc's address space the one currently
 *                "seen" by the processor.
 *
 *    as_deactivate - unload curproc's address space so it isn't
 *                currently "seen" by the processor. This is used to
 *                avoid potentially "seeing" it while it's being
 *                destroyed.
 *
 *    as_destroy - dispose of an address space. You may need to change
 *                the way this works if implementing user-level threads.
 *
 *    as_define_region - set up a region of memory within the address
 *                space.
 *
 *    as_prepare_load - this is called before actually loading from an
 *                executable into the address space.
 *
 *    as_complete_load - this is called when loading from an executable
 *                is complete.
 *
 *    as_define_stack - set up the stack region in the address space.
 *                (Normally called *after* as_complete_load().) Hands
 *                back the initial stack pointer for the new process.
 *
 * Note that when using dumbvm, addrspace.c is not used and these
 * functions are found in dumbvm.c.
